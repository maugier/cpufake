===========
cpufake 0.1
===========

This is a completely pointless module whose purpose is to change the CPU model name
in /proc/cpuinfo. I wrote this for a client who was unpleased not to see the real CPU
name when running under a virtual machine. Whatever...

Installation:

make
make install

Usage:

modprobe cpufake
echo "My UltraCool new Processor model" >/sys/modules/cpufake/parameters/cpuname
